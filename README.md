## Distributed Load Testing Using Kubernetes

This tutorial demonstrates how to conduct distributed load testing using [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) and includes a sample web application, Docker image, and Kubernetes controllers/services. For more background refer to the [Distributed Load Testing Using Kubernetes](http://cloud.google.com/solutions/distributed-load-testing-using-kubernetes) solution paper.

## Prerequisites

* Google Cloud Platform account
* Install and setup [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)

**Note:** when installing the Google Cloud SDK you will need to enable the following additional components:

* `App Engine Command Line Interface`
* `App Engine SDK for Python and PHP`
* `Compute Engine Command Line Interface`
* `Developer Preview gcloud Commands`
* `gcloud Alpha Commands`
* `gcloud app Python Extensions`
* `kubectl`

Before continuing, you can also set your preferred zone and project:

    $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
    $ gcloud config set project PROJECT-ID

## Deploy Web Application

The `sample-webapp` folder contains a simple Google App Engine Python application as the "system under test". To deploy the application to your project use the `gcloud app deploy` command.

    $ gcloud app deploy sample-webapp/app.yaml --project=PROJECT-ID

**Note:** you will need the URL of the deployed sample web application when deploying the `locust-master` and `locust-worker` controllers.

## Deploy Controllers and Services

Before deploying the `locust-master` and `locust-worker` controllers, update each to point to the location of your deployed sample web application. Set the `TARGET_HOST` environment variable found in the `spec.template.spec.containers.env` field to your sample web application URL.

    - name: TARGET_HOST
      value: http://PROJECT-ID.appspot.com

### Build Locust Docker Image

To build and publish Locust contoller Docker image, refer to the following steps.

First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) on your platform. Once Docker is installed and you've made changes to the `Dockerfile`, you can build, tag, and upload the image using the following steps:

    $ docker build -t USERNAME/locust-tasks .
    $ docker tag USERNAME/locust-tasks gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/locust-tasks
    $ gcloud preview docker --project PROJECT-ID push gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/locust-tasks

**Note:** you are not required to use the Google Container Registry. If you'd like to publish your images to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) please refer to the steps in [Working with Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerrepos/).

Once the Docker image has been built and uploaded to the registry you will need to edit the deployments with your new image location. Specifically, the `spec.template.spec.containers.image` field in each deployment controls which Docker image to use.

If you uploaded your Docker image to the Google Container Registry:

    image: gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/locust-tasks:latest

If you uploaded your Docker image to the Docker Hub:

    image: USERNAME/locust-tasks:latest

**Note:** the image location includes the `latest` tag so that the image is pulled down every time a new Pod is launched. To use a Kubernetes-cached copy of the image, remove `:latest` from the image location.

### Deploy Kubernetes Cluster

First create the [Google kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) cluster using the `gcloud` command as shown below. 

**Note:** This command defaults to creating a three node Kubernetes cluster (not counting the master) using the `n1-standard-1` machine type. Refer to the [`gcloud alpha container clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create) documentation information on specifying a different cluster configuration.

    $ gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER-NAME]

After a few minutes, you'll have a working Kubernetes cluster with three nodes (not counting the Kubernetes master). Next, configure your system to use the `kubectl` command:

    $ gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER-NAME]


### Deploy locust-master

Now that `kubectl` is setup, deploy the `locust-master-deployment`:

    $ kubectl create -f kubernetes-config/locust-master-deployment.yaml

To confirm that the deployment  and Pod are created, run the following:

    $ kubectl get deployments
    $ kubectl get pods -l name=locust,role=master

Next, deploy the `locust-master-service`:

    $ kubectl create -f kubernetes-config/locust-master-service.yaml

This step will expose the Pod with an internal DNS name (`locust-master`) and ports `8089`, `5557`, and `5558`. As part of this step, the `type: LoadBalancer` directive in `locust-master-service.yaml` will tell Google Container Engine to create a Google Compute Engine forwarding-rule from a publicly avaialble IP address to the `locust-master` Pod. To see the the service IP address ('LoadBalancer'), issue the below command:
 
   $ kubectl get services locust-master 

### Deploy locust-worker

Now deploy `locust-worker-deployment`:

    $ kubectl create -f kubernetes-config/locust-worker-deployment.yaml

The `locust-worker-deployment` is set to deploy 10 `locust-worker` Pods, to confirm they were deployed run the following:

    $ kubectl get pods -l name=locust,role=worker

To scale the number of `locust-worker` Pods, issue a deployment `scale` command.

    $ kubectl scale --replicas=20 deployment locust-worker

To confirm that the Pods have launched and are ready, get the list of `locust-worker` Pods:

    $ kubectl get pods -l name=locust,role=worker

**Note:** depending on the desired number of `locust-worker` Pods, the Kubernetes cluster may need to be launched with more than 3 compute engine nodes and may also need a machine type more powerful than n1-standard-1. Refer to the [`gcloud container clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create) documentation for more information.

## Execute Tests

To execute the Locust tests, navigate to the IP address of your locust-master-service LoadBalancer (see above) and port `8089` and enter the number of clients to spawn and the client hatch rate then start the simulation.

## Deployment Cleanup

To teardown the workload simulation cluster, use the following steps. First, delete the Kubernetes cluster:

    $ gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER-NAME

To delete the sample web application, visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
